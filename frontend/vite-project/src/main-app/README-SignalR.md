# CarePro SignalR Chat Frontend Implementation

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the SignalR chat implementation on the frontend and important integration points with the backend.

## Current Status
The frontend's SignalR chat system is fully implemented and prepared for integration with the backend. However, the backend ChatHub implementation is not yet complete. The frontend has been designed to gracefully handle this situation until the backend is ready.

## Key Components

### 1. MessageContext.jsx
Provides the chat context and state management for the messaging system:
- Manages conversations and messages
- Handles user online status
- Provides methods for sending and receiving messages

### 2. signalRChatService.js
Handles the connection to the SignalR ChatHub:
- Manages connection with error handling and reconnection
- Implements event handlers for various SignalR events
- Handles message sending and receiving

### 3. Messages.jsx
The main UI component for messaging:
- Uses MessageContext for data and operations
- Manages the chat connection lifecycle
- Provides UI for messaging and error states

## Integration with Backend

### Expected Backend Endpoints
The frontend expects a SignalR Hub available at:
```

```

### Required Methods
According to the `SignalR-Chat-Implementation-Guide.md`, the backend should implement:

1. `RegisterConnection(string userId)`
   - Registers a user's connection when they connect
   - Associates the connection ID with the user
   - Updates user's online status

2. `SendMessage(string senderId, string receiverId, string message)`
   - Sends a message from one user to another
   - Returns a message ID after storing the message

3. `GetMessageHistory(string user1Id, string user2Id, int skip, int take)`
   - Retrieves message history between two users
   - Supports pagination

4. Other methods as specified in the implementation guide

### Current Workarounds
The frontend has been modified to gracefully handle situations where:
- The backend isn't fully implemented
- The `RegisterConnection` method isn't available
- Connection errors occur

## Next Steps for Backend Developers
1. Implement the ChatHub as specified in `/backend/SignalR-Chat-Implementation-Guide.md`
2. Ensure all required methods are available and functioning
3. Test the integration with the frontend
4. Notify the frontend team when the implementation is ready

## Testing the Integration
Once the backend is ready:
1. Start both the frontend and backend applications
2. Login with two different user accounts in separate browsers or incognito windows
3. Test sending messages between the users
4. Verify that online status is properly updated
5. Test reconnection scenarios by temporarily disabling network connectivity
