# Care-Pro API - AI Integration and Verification System

This document summarizes the changes made to implement AI assessment, identity verification with Dojah, and a recommendation system without relying on local database models.

## Key Changes

1. **Authentication & Verification**
   - Updated the authentication middleware to work directly with external API endpoints
   - Removed dependencies on local user models
   - Added functionality to update user verification status via external API

2. **Dojah Identity Verification**
   - Kept the existing Dojah service implementation
   - Modified controllers to use external API for storing verification results
   - Implemented API endpoints for NIN, BVN, and address verification

3. **AI Assessment for Caregivers**
   - Maintained OpenAI integration for caregiver assessment
   - Modified controllers to send assessment results to the external API
   - Implemented scoring and qualification status determination

4. **Recommendation System for Clients**
   - Created new recommendation controller and routes
   - Implemented client-caregiver matching algorithms
   - Added AI-powered analysis of client needs and preferences

## Removed Dependencies

- Removed reliance on local MongoDB models:
  - UserModel
  - AssessmentModel
  - VerificationModel
  - ClientServiceRequestModel
  - ProviderServiceModel
  - GigModel

## New Endpoints

### Recommendation Endpoints
- `POST /api/recommendations/client-recommendations` - Get recommended caregivers for a client
- `GET /api/recommendations/caregiver-matches` - Get recommended clients for a caregiver

### KYC and Verification Endpoints
- All existing KYC endpoints are maintained but now work with external API

## Implementation Notes

1. The system now verifies users through the external authentication API using the baseURL: `https://carepro-api20241118153443.azurewebsites.net/api`

2. After verification with Dojah, the system updates the user's verification status in the external API.

3. For caregiver assessment, the system evaluates responses using OpenAI and updates the qualification status in the external API.

4. For client recommendations, the system fetches gigs from the external API endpoints and ranks them based on client preferences.

## Next Steps

1. Test all endpoints thoroughly with real data
2. Implement error handling for external API failures
3. Add additional logging for debugging purposes
4. Improve the matching algorithms for better recommendations
