# CarePro - Healthcare Professional Connection Platform

## Overview
CarePro is a comprehensive platform designed to connect qualified healthcare professionals (particularly caregivers) with clients needing care services. The platform streamlines caregiver verification, qualification assessment, and service matching through AI-powered systems while facilitating secure real-time communication between clients and providers.

### Core Features
- **Healthcare Professional Verification & Qualification:** AI-powered assessment system that evaluates healthcare providers' qualifications through dynamic questionnaires
- **Know Your Customer (KYC) Verification:** Secure identity verification for both caregivers and clients using Dojah
- **Real-time Messaging:** SignalR-based chat system for instant communication between clients and caregivers
- **Service Matching System:** AI-powered matching of clients with appropriate caregivers based on needs, preferences and location
- **Gig Management:** Complete platform for caregivers to create, manage and promote their services
- **Client Care Management:** Tools for clients to define care needs, find matching providers, and manage service requests

### Project Structure
The project is structured into three key components:
1. **frontend** - React-based client application built with Vite
2. **node-API** - Node.js middleware for verification, assessment, and service matching
3. **backend** - C# ASP.NET Core backend services with Azure SQL and MongoDB databases

## Developer Notes

### SignalR Chat System Implementation
The frontend's messaging system is built using SignalR for real-time communication between clients and caregivers. Key components include:

1. **MessageContext.jsx**: Provides the chat context and state management for the messaging system
2. **signalRChatService.js**: Handles the connection to the SignalR ChatHub on the backend
3. **Messages.jsx**: The main messaging UI component that consumes the MessageContext

The frontend is designed to gracefully handle cases where the backend SignalR hub isn't fully implemented yet. Specifically:

- It handles the case where the `RegisterConnection` method isn't available on the server
- It implements proper cleanup function handling to prevent "cleanup is not a function" errors
- It includes fallback mechanisms for connection failures and offline mode

Note for backend developers: Please implement the ChatHub according to the specifications in `/backend/SignalR-Chat-Implementation-Guide.md` to ensure compatibility with the frontend.
