# Assessment System Upgrade Status

## Completed Tasks

1. **OpenAI Service Enhancement**
   - Added `generateMultipleChoiceQuestions` function to create structured multiple-choice questions
   - Updated the evaluation system to use a 70% passing threshold (from 50%)
   - Improved the prompt system to support generated structured question data

2. **Node API Updates**
   - Added a new endpoint `/api/kyc/generate-question-bank` to generate and store questions
   - Updated the question evaluation to reflect the 70% passing threshold
   - Added batch processing capabilities for efficient question generation

3. **Question Bank Generation**
   - Created a script (`generateQuestionBank.js`) to batch generate all 200 questions:
     - 50 for Cleaners/Home Managers across 4 categories
     - 150 for Caregivers across 8 categories
   - Added proper logging and error handling for the generation process

4. **Documentation**
   - Created `QuestionBankGeneration.md` with detailed instructions on using the new system
   - Updated the assessment flow documentation to reflect the new process

## Verification

- Confirmed the .NET backend already uses the 70% threshold in `AssessmentService.cs`
- Confirmed the database schema (QuestionBank and Assessment entities) is already set up
- Confirmed the API endpoints for storing and retrieving questions already exist

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test the question bank generation process
   - Verify questions are stored correctly in MongoDB
   - Test the question retrieval and randomization for assessments

2. **Frontend Updates**
   - Update the assessment UI to support multiple-choice only format
   - Update the results display to show the 70% threshold
   - Add proper explanation of correct/incorrect answers

3. **Admin Interface**
   - Implement the admin interface for question bank management
   - Add question performance analytics
   - Add question flagging system for review

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Test the full assessment flow end-to-end
   - Verify proper scoring and feedback
   - Test edge cases and error handling

## Usage Instructions

1. **Generate Question Bank**
   ```bash
   cd node-API
   node src/scripts/generateQuestionBank.js
   ```

2. **View Question Bank**
   - Use MongoDB tools to verify questions are stored correctly
   - Use the backend API: `GET /api/QuestionBank` to view all questions

3. **Test Assessment Flow**
   - Create a test user with either "Cleaner" or "Caregiver" role
   - Start an assessment and verify the correct number of questions are presented
   - Submit answers and verify scoring uses the 70% threshold

## New Features

- **Question Bank Storage**: Questions are now persisted in the database instead of generated on-demand
- **Structured Questions**: All questions follow a consistent multiple-choice format with 4 options
- **Higher Quality Standards**: Passing threshold increased to 70% for better quality assurance
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Questions now cover all 8 required knowledge categories
- **Analytics Ready**: System now captures detailed assessment data for future analysis
