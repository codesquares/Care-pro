# Verification System Fix Documentation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication Middleware Issue
- Fixed duplicate variable declaration in `authMiddleware.js` that was causing syntax errors
- The duplicate line `user.userType = userType;` was removed

### 2. Verification Service Refactoring
- Fixed syntax errors in the `verificationService.js` file
- Fixed the issue where there were two `verificationService` declarations with no proper closing bracket
- Improved code organization following modern JavaScript best practices
- Added proper `this` references for object methods to ensure the correct scope
- Added a helper method `_getTestValue` to reduce code duplication for test environment handling
- Improved error handling with optional chaining to prevent runtime errors
- Fixed debouncing logic for verification status requests
- Enhanced handling of 401 errors by properly returning cached data

### 3. Key Improvements for API Authorization
- Ensured the authorization token is properly passed to the verification API
- Improved error handling specifically for 401 Unauthorized responses
- Added fallback to cached verification status when API authentication fails
- Explicitly added token to the headers for `/kyc/status` requests

## How to Apply the Fix

1. Run the `apply-verification-fixes.sh` script to apply all changes:
   ```bash

   ```

2. Restart the Node.js server to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   cd node-API
   npm run start
   ```

3. Restart the frontend development server:

   cd frontend/vite-project
   npm run dev
   ```

## Verification

After applying the fix, please verify that:
1. Client users can access the verification status through `/api/kyc/status` endpoint
2. No more 401 Unauthorized errors appear in the console
3. The verification process completes successfully for both caregiver and client users
